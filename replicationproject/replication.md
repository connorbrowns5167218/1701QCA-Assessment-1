## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Temperature Gauge ###

### Project description ###

This project is a temperature gauge that measures the temperature of the CPU on the micro:bit. If the temperature exceeds the set threshold then the motor fan is turned on and a unhappy face us displayed along with a beeping sound. If the temperature is below the threshold then the motor fan is turned off and a happy face is displayed. This project would typically be used by IT professionals for their computers and related equipment. This project would warn them if anything was beginning to overheat so that they could turn it off or adjust the temperature somehow.

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*

The parts of the project I felt were most successful were the motor and fan as they worked as intended. To improve upon this project I would choose a better display instead of using the micro:bit leds, and I would add a better sound maybe with a speaker. 

*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*

I found the techniques of all of the related projects to be useful in this project.

*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*

I read the provided project example on the class powerpoints. I then thought of how to make this project using a motor fan instead of a servo as I did not have a servo to use.

*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*

It would be interesting to incorporate this into an actual PC to use as a real cooling system.
